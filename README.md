# First Generation Pokedex

This project is a first generation Pokedex web application built with Vue.js! The purpose of this project is to showcase how to build a client-side web app with Vue.js and access data from a third party API. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
## Credits

Thank you [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for providing endpoints for the data.
